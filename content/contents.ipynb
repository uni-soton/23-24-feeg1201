    "1. How can I undo my changes to the notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "   If you have modified a notebook and want to go back to the original notebook, you need to go to the file browser (left-panel when you start the session) and select *delete*  (probably via right-click). You are not deleting the file, you are deleting your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Can I get the modified notebooks from the browser onto my computer?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Yes. While the relevant notebook is openend, go to `File -> Download` to download a copy of the notebook onto your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Can I upload notebooks (and other files) into my JupyterLite (i.e. into the browser)?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Yes. There is a upload icon (Arrow pointing up).\n"
