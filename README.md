## Interactive Python examples: executable lecture notes

[Here](https://uni-soton.github.io/23-24-feeg1201/lab/index.html) you can find examples from the Python lectures of FEEG1012 for interactive exploration in your browser: https://uni-soton.github.io/23-24-feeg1201/lab/index.html)

- you do not need to install any python software
- the examples run in your browser in a Jupyter Lab environment (called "JupyterLite")

- any files you create or modify may be lost (or saved in your browser cache):
  - if you want to keep any modified files, make sure you download them from the Jupyter Lab (Open the relevant file, then go to `File` -> `Download`).
- if you want to revert a file that was provided and you have modified, you can right-click on it and select `Delete`.
