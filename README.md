## Interactive Python examples

Here you can find examples from the Python lectures of FEEG1012 for interactive exploration in your browser:


- you do not need to install any python software
- the examples run in your browser in a Jupyter Lab environment

- any files you save may be lost (or saved in your browser cache)
  - if you want to keep any modified files, make sure you download them from the Jupyter Lab (Open the relevant file, then go to `File` -> `Download`).

## Requirements

JupyterLite is being tested against modern web browsers:

- Firefox 90+
- Chromium 89+
